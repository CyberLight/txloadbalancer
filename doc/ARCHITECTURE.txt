Some ASCII "art" for you:

               Director = starts manager, admin, selects scheduler and starts
                   |      listeners
                   |
  +-------------+--------------+--------------+
  |             |              |              |
Manager       Admin        Schedulers     Listeners
  =             =              =              =
reconfig,     web ui        lb type,       proxies
dead hosts,                algorithms,


Currently, the Manager and Admin are threaded, the Listeners are Twisted, and
Schedulers are simple python objects doing duty as state machines and
selection algorithms.

The plan is to do the folowing:
 * make the Director into a twisted application
 * recreate the manager to be a timer service
 * add an HTTP service to replace the current admin
